## Overview

### The challenge

Create a static stats preview card component just using HTML & CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

That in some cases you need to use both flex/grid and not solely one over the other. That is why there is two Html and Css files. The Html file stops before any @media changes were made.

## Acknowledgments

I intially did this assignment in nothing but flex instead of flex/grid. Doing the assignment in nothing but flex made it difficult to make the website responsive especially in mobile view. So I followed along another video I had found that showed how to use grid properly. [link]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhBR6-Jjql4 from youtuber: Mr.Coder
